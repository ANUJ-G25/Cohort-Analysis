# Cohort-Analysis
Cohort Analysis is an essential technique for businesses, offering a granular and actionable understanding of user behavior. This project involves a systematic approach to performing Cohort Analysis, ensuring comprehensive insights into user interactions over time.

The process begins with defining cohorts based on specific characteristics or events. For instance, on an e-commerce platform, cohorts can be categorized by the month of a userâ€™s first purchase. Relevant data is gathered for analysis, and time intervals are determined for examination, grouping users accordingly.

Key performance metrics are selected for evaluation and calculated for each cohort over specified periods. Visualizations are created to effectively present the findings, highlighting insights derived from the data.

The dataset includes crucial user data such as registration dates, purchase history, and engagement metrics. This dataset is ideal for conducting a thorough Cohort Analysis, enabling a deep dive into user behavior and retention patterns. The project aims to uncover valuable trends and patterns, providing actionable insights that can inform business strategies and improve user engagement.
