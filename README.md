# Cohort-Analysis
This project utilizes Cohort Analysis to gain a detailed understanding of user behavior by defining cohorts based on specific characteristics, such as the month of a userâ€™s first purchase. We gather and analyze relevant data, determine key performance metrics, and calculate these metrics for each cohort over specified time intervals. Visualizations are created to effectively present the findings. The dataset includes user registration dates, purchase history, and engagement metrics, providing a comprehensive view of user interactions and retention patterns.
